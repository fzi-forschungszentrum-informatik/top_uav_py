# TOP-UAV: Open-Source Time-optimal Trajectory Planner for Point-Masses under Acceleration and Velocity Constraints (Python)
top_uav_py is a Python library to generate 3-dimensional time-optimal trajectories from an initial position and velocity vector to a final position and velocity vector with constraints on the maximum velocity and acceleration for the entire motion.

## üíà Installation
```shell
pip install requirements.txt
```

To access the C++ implementation see [top_uav_cpp](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/top_uav_cpp).

## üç´ Quickstart
The example in main.py generates time-optimal trajectories according to the state-of-the-art method as well as of our basic generally valid version as well as our version with improved exploitation of kinematic properties.
